## Introduction

The following report documents the methods and procedures I used to create a prediction model on a dataset of census information.  I obtained the dataset from Kaggle.com at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income.  The original dataset consisted of the following 15 columns:
* age (integer) - The age of each entry
* workclass (string) - The workclass of each entry.  Options include: private, local government, federal government, self-employed
* fnlwgt (integer) - The final weight of that row.  This relates to how many unique census entries were of this row's characteristics.  In order to preserve the tidy format of the dataset, I did not include the fnlwgt column in my computations.
* education (string) - The highest form of education for each entry.  Options include: HS-grad, Masters, 10th
* education.num (integer) - The total number of years spent in education for each entry
* marital.status (string) - The marital status of each entry
* occupation (string) - The occupation of each entry
* relationship (string) - The family-relationship held by each entry.  Options include: Mother, Father, Not-in-Family, Unmarried
* race (string) - The race of each entry
* sex (string) - The sex of each entry
* capital.gain (integer) - The capitol gain of each entry
* capital.loss (integer) - The capitol loss of each entry
* hours.per.week (integer) - The hours per week worked by each entry
* native.country (string) - The native country of each entry
* income (string) - The annual income of each entry as defined categorically as less than or equal to $50,000 (<=50K) and greater than $50,000 (>50K).

I used the census dataset to generate a model that predicts the categorical income of an entry given the other attributes of that entry.  


## Methods
### Data Preparation
```{r, echo= FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)
library(rpart)				       

library(rattle)					
library(rpart.plot)			

file <- "adult-census-income.zip"

dat <- read.csv(unzip(file))

```

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com as a zipped csv file.  I read in the dataset and examined it for dimensionality and completeness. 

```{r, echo= FALSE}
dim.dat <- dim(dat)
dat.na <- sum(is.na(dat$income))
message("The data has ", dim.dat[1], " rows,  ", dim.dat[2], " columns, and ", 
        dat.na, " missing values (NA).")
```

Next, I randomly split the original dataset into training and testing datasets comprised of 90% and 10% of the original dataset, respectively.  























This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
